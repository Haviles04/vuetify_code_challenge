# Vuetify Code Challenge

This is a code challenge, for vuetify. The objective was to create a blog with CRUD capabilities using vue, and vuetify.

- For the ability to showcase CRUD capabilites I used the backend node.js framework Sails.js, I chose sails for it's in-memory database featues which allows you to test out your controllers and apis functionality without having to setup an actual database.

- For the frontend I used Vue and Vuetify to construct a simple blog application, you can add a blog on the main page, or you can click 'View More' to navigate to that blogs own page where you can update or delete it. You can then click the home icon on the top right to bring you back to all the blogs.

## Setup

- Clone Repo
- CD client
- Install dependencies `npm ci`
- run `npm run dev`
- Open new terminal
- CD server
- Install dependencies `npm ci`
- if you have the sails CLI you can run `sails lift` otherwise run `node app.js`
